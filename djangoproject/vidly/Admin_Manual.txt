# All django project comes with a powerful admin panel which is also called an app of our project
# To see the admin login -> serverlink/admin
# The admin panel is available because there is an installed app in settings.py which is -> 'django.contrib.auth'
# This app is a small reusable package that we can use in our project

## First step is to create the super user of our database
# Open new terminal -> :python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    username: admin
    email address: anything@email.com
    password: anything strong. if we use weak password then type y and bypass with the weak password (here 1234 for this project)
